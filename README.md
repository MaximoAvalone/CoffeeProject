# Coffee Shop Project


## Project Description
This project simulates an ordering system in a Coffee Shop through the Command Line Interface. The user can order from
a selection of drinks of two types: Teas and Coffees. Created for the class CSS 142

I created this programming using the basic programming concepts taught in CSS 142 Class, this is a demonstration of my programming skills at this time.

A challenge in the creation of this project was the use of Inheritance and teaching myself these concepts through the use of online resources.

Future feature that I hope to implement is a more refined user interface, I want to simulate a kiosk that would be found at a self ordering station of a Coffee shop.
